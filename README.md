# Multiple document summary with topic modeling

This project is designed to provide a summary from multiple documents based on a particular topic. It takes a number of documents as input with a mixture of topics, clusters the documents using k-means clustering algorithm, finds the topic of each cluster using LDA topic modeling algorithm, and generates a summary of cluster having required topic using the summarization pipeline in Hugging Face.

#Usage
